# TY175
Projects to do with a Yamaha TY175 build.
- Flywheel cover: still a work in progress. The V2 cover works well, and bolts up nicely, but is a bit too wide to use the stock shift lever. STL needs to be modified, or shift lever needs to be bent out and/or fabbed to suit.
- Suzuki RL250 tank mount: OEM style mount, for the forward mounts on an original Suzuki fuel tank.  
- TY175 Oil pump cover: rubber blockoff to replace the original rubber grommet that the cable and oil line passed through.
